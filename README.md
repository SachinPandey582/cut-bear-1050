    <h1># cut-bear-1050</h1>
    the first day was bit easy i started when i got it.

    <h4>2nd day -</h4>
    i remeber asking silly question from my IA that hurt when he said silly so
    thanks to him i motivated that was something when i made something but i
    felt like i am fearing from redux so i started to use the redux fully

    <h4>3rd day</h4>
    it was full of tension will i be able to do that or not so i started and i
    succesfully achieved some process with redux i was happy

    <h4>4th day</h4>
    again this day was full of problems but i managed to pull it out

    <h4>5th day -</h4>
    i messed up here so i changed the navbar with chakra which cause me lost of
    responsiveness But overall i was successfully able to do that much thing
    hoping to do better in the future
