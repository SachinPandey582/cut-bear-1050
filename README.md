# cut-bear-1050
the first day was bit easy i started when i got it.


2nd day -
i remeber asking silly question from my IA that hurt when he said silly so thanks to him i motivated
 that was something when i made something but i felt like i am fearing from redux 
 so i started to use the redux fully 
 
 
 3rd day 
 it was full of tension will i be able to do that or not so i started and i succesfully achieved some process with redux 
 i was happy 
 
 
 4th day
 again this day was full of problems but i managed to pull it out 
 
 5th day - 
 i messed up here so i changed the navbar with chakra which cause me lost of responsiveness 
 
 But overall i was successfully able to do that much thing hoping to do better in the future
